"Cyberstride" was originally the name of complex modeling software written back in the 70's to optimize the economy of Chile. This spirit of idealism and innovation is what inspired us to take the name for our company.

We love working with start-ups because entrepreneurs share that same spirit. There is nothing quite like recognizing a problem or an opportunity and then having that light-bulb go off in your head. We live for those moments and like working with clients who do too.
